## Day 6: Key Takeaways

1. **Built-in Functions**  
   - Python has several built-in functions that I can use globally, such as `print()` and `len()`.

2. **Function Parameters**  
   - Functions in Python can accept parameters, similar to how JavaScript functions work.

3. **Learning Functions with Reeborg's World**  
   - Angela Yu introduced me to Reeborg's World to help understand Python functions in an easy and interactive way.

4. **Indentation in Functions**  
   - After defining a function with a colon, the subsequent code must be indented (shifted right by 4 spaces).

5. **PEP 8: Spaces vs. Tabs**  
   - Pythonâ€™s PEP 8 style guide recommends using spaces over tabs for indentation.

6. **Spaces vs. Tabs: A Fun Fact**  
   - Statistically, Python developers who use spaces earn more than those who use tabs.

7. **`while` Loops in Python**  
   - A `while` loop runs as long as a specified condition is true.  
   Example:
   ```python
   while something_is_true < number:
       print("I love Python")
       something_is_true += 1
   ```

8. **Choosing `for` vs. `while` Loops**  
   - Use `for` loops when you know the exact number of iterations.  
   - Use `while` loops when the number of iterations depends on a condition.

9. **Debugging Infinite Loops**  
   - Angela Yu's tip: If stuck in an infinite loop, add a `print()` statement inside the loop to see the result of the condition at each iteration.

10. **Nested Conditions Practice**  
   - Practiced nested conditions extensively, which helped improve my understanding of how conditions work in Python.
