## Day 10: Key Takeaways

1. **Functions with Outputs**  
   - Functions with outputs are similar to functions with parameters, but they use the `return` keyword to send data back to the global scope.

2. **Calculator Project**  
   - Ended the day by building a calculator app.

3. **Using the `return` Keyword**  
   - The `return` keyword is used to send the result of a function back to the global scope.

4. **Accessing Function Output**  
   - You can assign the function's output to a variable to access it in the global scope.

5. **Printing Function Output**  
   - Alternatively, you can use a function like `print()` directly on the returned value.

6. **Nested Functions**  
   - You can nest functions by calling one function within another, using the `return` keyword to pass results between them.

7. **Ending a Function with `return`**  
   - The `return` keyword signals that the function's execution is complete.

8. **Code After `return`**  
   - Any code after the `return` statement won’t execute unless it's part of another scope (e.g., inside a condition).

9. **Correct Indentation for `return`**  
   - The `return` statement must be indented properly inside the function to work correctly.

10. **Return Ends Execution**  
   - Once Python encounters a `return` statement, it stops executing the function and returns the result.

11. **Multiple Return Statements**  
   - Functions can have multiple `return` statements, often used within conditional blocks.

12. **Leap Year Exercise**  
   - Successfully completed an exercise on leap years, focusing on correct indentation of `if` and `else` statements.

13. **Docstrings**  
   - Docstrings are multi-line comments that provide documentation for functions.

14. **Assigning Functions to Variables**  
   - Learned that I can assign a function to a variable, then call that variable with keyword arguments to pass parameters to the function.

15. **Calculator Project Difficulty**  
   - The calculator project was of medium difficulty, requiring attention to conditions and proper indentation. I feel like I’m improving.

16. **Continuing with draw.io**  
   - I will keep using draw.io to visualize my code logic and improve understanding.

17. **Avoid Repeating Code**  
   - Repeating code should be avoided by using loops or other techniques to handle repetition.

18. **Recursion**  
   - Recursion is when a function calls itself during its execution.
