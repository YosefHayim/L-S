## Day 39: Key Takeaways

1. **Today's Learnings**  
   - Built an app that finds cheap flight deals for personal use (Part 1).
   - Created a user database so people can register for the service and use it as well (Part 2).

2. **Notes While Coding**  
   - API documentation can be really confusing because there is a lot of data and many methods for each API endpoint.
   - Using ChatGPT can reduce the amount of time spent reading documentation, but as a beginner, it's important to learn and dive into it first. Later, ChatGPT can be a time-saving tool.
   - Breaking down the steps and tackling one part at a time is really helping to build the code.
   - I need to pay more attention to the Pomodoro technique and stick to the time intervals I've set: 30 minutes of learning, 10 minutes of break.
   - My main frustration comes from not always remembering the classes or methods to use with the classes. However, I do understand how everything flows, and I think that's the most important part.
   - I will start using the `dotenv` package to follow best practices for storing encrypted data, as most developers do.
