# FreeCodeCamp: Scientific Computing with Python (Beta)

Welcome to my repository documenting my progress in the FreeCodeCamp "Scientific Computing with Python (Beta)" certification. This course equips me with the skills to analyze and manipulate data using Python. I'll be diving into data structures, algorithms, and Object-Oriented Programming, applying these concepts to solve complex problems.

## What I'll Learn

- **Python Programming:** Master Python concepts like variables, loops, functions, and conditional statements.
- **Data Structures and Algorithms:** Learn to implement key data structures and algorithms to solve computational problems.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Understand OOP principles and apply them to Python projects.
- **Scientific Computing:** Perform complex calculations using Python libraries and methods.

## Course Structure

- **Projects:** Hands-on projects that reinforce scientific computing concepts in Python.
- **Certification:** Earn the FreeCodeCamp Scientific Computing with Python certification upon course completion.

## Tools and Resources

- **Python Version:** Python 3.x
- **Development Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code
- **External Libraries:** Will be mentioned in individual project descriptions as required.
