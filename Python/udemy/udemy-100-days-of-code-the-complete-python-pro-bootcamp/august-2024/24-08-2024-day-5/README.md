## Day 5: Key Takeaways

1. **Data Breach Check: Have I Been Pwned**  
   - [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com) is a website that allows you to check if your personal data has been compromised in data breaches.

2. **`for` Loop**  
   - The `for` loop iterates over each item in a sequence and performs an action on each item, or optionally, no action.

3. **Printing a Loop Variable Outside the Loop**  
   - To print a loop variable outside the loop, store it in another variable within the loop, then print that variable after the loop finishes. Otherwise, it wonâ€™t be accessible.

4. **Order of Conditions in `if` Statements**  
   - The order of `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements matters. More specific or complex conditions should come before simpler ones.  
   - For example, when checking conditions like `i % 3 == 0` and `i % 5 == 0` (for FizzBuzz), check for both conditions first (`i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0`) to avoid incorrect outcomes.
