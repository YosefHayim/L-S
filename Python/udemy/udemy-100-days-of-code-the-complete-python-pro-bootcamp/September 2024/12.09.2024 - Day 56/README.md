## Day 56: Key Takeaways

### 1. **Today's Goals**
   - Learn how to include static files (such as images and videos) in Flask applications.
   - Understand how to render HTML and CSS files in Flask.
   - Apply web design principles using HTML and CSS within Flask applications.
   - Build a personal name card application that showcases your information and links.

### 2. **Things I Learned or Concluded from Today's Lesson**
   - Flask allows you to serve static files (like images, videos, or stylesheets) easily by using the `static` folder.
   - You can render HTML and CSS files using Flask's `render_template()` method to deliver a fully styled webpage.
   - Creating personal web applications, like a digital name card, is an efficient and modern way to share contact details and showcase design skills.
   - Incorporating HTML and CSS with Flask gives your website a professional structure, building upon the basic web design principles we've learned previously.
   - Holding **Shift** and clicking the reload button in Chrome will force the browser to reload all static files it has cached, ensuring any updates made to the server are reflected.
   - By inspecting the website, navigating to the **Console** tab, and typing the command `document.body.contentEditable = true`, you can dynamically edit the webpage content with just a click. If you want to save the changes, you can save the page as an HTML file, which will preserve the updated content.
