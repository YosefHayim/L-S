## What I’ve Learned

Throughout this bootcamp, I’ve gained a solid foundation in:

- **Core Python Programming**: Variables, data types, functions, loops, and conditional statements.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and method overloading.
- **API Integration**: Working with APIs to get and post data, using `requests`, `smtplib`, and managing authentication with environment variables.
- **Data Structures**: Manipulating lists, dictionaries, and learning more advanced concepts like list comprehensions and nested data.
- **File Handling**: Reading from and writing to files, working with CSV data and JSON.
- **Web Scraping**: Extracting data from websites using BeautifulSoup and automating web interactions with Selenium.
- **Graphical User Interfaces (GUI)**: Creating interactive applications with `Tkinter`, including flash cards, password managers, and quiz games.

I will continue to update this list as I complete the remaining projects and further develop my Python skills.
