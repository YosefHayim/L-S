## Day 66: Key Takeaways

1. **Today goals**  
   - Building a full REST API from scratch using Flask.
   - Understanding the REST architectural style.
   - Implementing HTTP request methods: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE.
   - Learning RESTful routing.

2. **Things I learned or concluded from today's lesson**  
   - REST stands for representational state transfer.
   - HTTP is not the only language servers can understand.
   - RESTful routing follows a specific pattern using endpoints and URLs.
   - REST is an architectural style, like Baroque or Gothic, for APIs.
   - HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) map closely to CRUD operations.
   - HTTPS adds security via encryption, like a secret code.

3. **General Conclusion from the Transcript**  
   - The key difference between `PUT` and `PATCH` can be understood using an analogy:
     - `PUT`: Like sending a brand new bicycle to replace a broken one, `PUT` updates the entire resource in the database.
     - `PATCH`: Like sending just a new tire to fix a broken bike, `PATCH` updates only the specific part of the resource that needs to be changed, saving resources and time.
