## Day 38: Key Takeaways

1. **Today's Learnings**  
   - Building an exercise tracker with Python and Google Sheets using APIs.

2. **Environment Variables**  
   - Store secure variables in a separate folder to avoid exposing API keys.

3. **Lessons from Hands-On Practice**  
   - Read the API documentation carefully.
   - Use ChatGPT to speed up the process by asking for general key points, endpoints, etc.
   - Work in a sandbox environment, especially at the beginning, to make multiple API calls and understand what works.
   - Use a `for` loop to iterate over the response JSON, which is returned as a dictionary in Python.
   - Follow the Pomodoro technique, working for 25 minutes at a time, to stay productive.
