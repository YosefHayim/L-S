Key points of day 18:
1 -  Deep learning of Turtle Graphics, Tuples and Importing Modules.
2 - Tk stands for Tk interface, one of the ways to create graphical user interface also known as "GUI".
3 - Using the asterisk import everything from the module / library.
4 - I can import module or libraries with the word "as" and set it to a short name which is a shortcut similar from SQL server.
5 - Tuple is a data type in Python, has round parenthesis and each data type inside is separated by comma
6 - I can access a tuple data by using the indexes like in a list.
7 - I cannot change values of tuples, only access the data.
8 - I can convert a tuple to a list and then modify the list by using the method list(my_tuple)
9 - Read the API doc but in the same time understand what methods I must use in order to do other complexity. e.g. I stacked on the code for around 30 min because I didn't use the method to change colormode to rgb.
10 - using num % 10 == 0 basically allows me to check when I reached another round number. e.g. 10-20-30-40...
