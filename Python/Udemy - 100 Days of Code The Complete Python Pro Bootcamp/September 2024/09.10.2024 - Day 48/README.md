## Day 48: Key Takeaways

1. **What am I going to build today?**

   - Learning to use Selenium WebDriver for browser automation.

2. **Things I learned or concluded from today's lesson:**

   - Selenium WebDriver is useful for automating tasks in a web browser.
   - Itâ€™s better for dynamic websites (e.g., pages using JavaScript) compared to BeautifulSoup.
   - Selenium is a free tool that can simulate human actions on websites, like clicking, typing, and scraping data.

3. **Selenium Lessons Notes:**
   - `find_element()` helps locate HTML elements by ID, class, or XPath.
   - Always inspect a website's structure before scraping because elements can change.
   - Selenium automates the browser, making it easier to interact with web pages than static scraping tools like BeautifulSoup.
