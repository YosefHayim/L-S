Key points of day 23:
1 - Building a Capstone Project: Turtle Crossing Game
2 - Was pretty easy, I used a lot of chatGPT, but it was mainly because I am lazy to read the document of the turtle. 
3 - I understand every single part that is happening, the classes are being now clearer to understand and understanding how they work.
