1. **HTML Boilerplate**  
   - The basic structure used when creating a new HTML file.
   - The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration tells the browser that the document is written in HTML5.
   - The `<html></html>` tags are the root of the document and enclose all other elements.

2. **Head Element**  
   - The head section contains metadata that helps browsers render the site correctly but isn't visible to users.
   - Important tags include the character set encoding (`<meta charset="UTF-8">`) and the `<title></title>` tag for the title displayed in the browser tab.

3. **Body Element**  
   - The body contains all the visible content of the website, such as text, images, and links.
   - Everything visible on the webpage is placed between the opening and closing `<body>` tags.

4. **Nesting and Indentation**  
   - HTML elements are nested, with each element opening and closing inside others, much like layers in a hamburger.
   - Proper indentation helps visualize this structure and keeps the code tidy and readable.

5. **Meta Tags and Viewport**  
   - The `<meta>` tags in the head section ensure proper encoding and display.
   - The viewport tag ensures correct scaling of the website on different devices.

6. **Shortcuts in VS Code**  
   - You can quickly generate the HTML boilerplate by typing `!` and pressing Enter in a .html file. 

7. **Creating Your Own HTML Structure**  
   - Practice building your own structure by creating elements and nesting them properly.
