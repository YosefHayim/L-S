4. **Data Creation Order Matters**  
   - The order in which you create or structure data is important to get the expected results.

5. **Pandas is Powerful**  
   - Pandas provides a wide range of powerful tools for data manipulation and analysis.

6. **Handling Data with Spaces**  
   - When a data column contains spaces, double quotes are needed to search or match that specific column.
