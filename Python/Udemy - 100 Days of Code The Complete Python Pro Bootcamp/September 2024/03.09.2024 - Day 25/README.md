Key points of day 25:
1 - Learning how to work with CSV files and analysing data with Pandas library.
2 - CSV stands for "comma separated values".
3 - When using pandas library, Angela said in the previous lessons that when I call a method in a function or opposite I can remove the () well it seem to not work after I tried.
4 - The order of creating the data does matter in order to make it the same as I want.
5 - pandas is powerful.
6 - if a data column has spaces I need to use double quotes in order to search for that specific match.
7 - Using the method variable.title() makes the first letter title letter e.g. Joseph.
