## Day 41: Key Takeaways

1. **How does the Internet work?**  
   - The Internet is essentially a long piece of wire connecting computers across the world.
   - Some computers, called **Servers**, must stay online 24/7 to serve data and files to users.  
   - The computers users use to access the Internet are called **Clients**.
   - Servers are like a giant library, always open, serving data (websites, files) to users when requested.

2. **How are requests handled?**  
   - When you type a website URL, your browser sends a request to your **Internet Service Provider (ISP)**.
   - The ISP then relays the request to a **DNS (Domain Name System) server**, which acts like a phone book and finds the website's IP address.
   - Every computer connected to the Internet has a unique IP address, like a postal code, which helps locate and send data to the right place.

3. **Dynamic IPs and CDNs**  
   - Many websites, including Google, use **Dynamic IP addresses** and **Content Delivery Networks (CDN)**.
   - A CDN ensures you're connected to the closest server, improving speed and efficiency.

4. **Undersea cables**  
   - The world’s continents are connected by massive undersea cables, which consist of hundreds of fiber optic strands, transmitting data using lasers at incredibly high speeds (up to 400 GB per second).

5. **Speed of data**  
   - When you access a website, data travels through wires and cables, both above and under the sea, at the speed of light, allowing you to access websites from across the world in milliseconds.

6. **How websites work**  
   - Websites are accessed through browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox), which fetch the website's data (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) from a server.
   - The browser converts this data into the visual websites we interact with.

7. **HTML: The Structure**  
   - HTML is responsible for building the **structure** of a website, much like a builder constructing the walls of a house.
   - It includes elements like images, buttons, text boxes, and more.
   - HTML stands for **HyperText Markup Language**.
   - Tags are the opening and closing elements in HTML, e.g., `<h1>text</h1>`. The text inside the tags is the element's content.
   - There are 6 types of headings in HTML, from `<h1>` (the largest) to `<h6>` (the smallest).
   - Lorem Ipsum: This is placeholder text often used during the design process of a website. It helps designers visualize how the content will look on the page without needing actual text. The text itself is nonsensical, derived from a piece of classical Latin literature, and serves as a way to focus on layout rather than content.
   - Horizontal Rule element is a draw line that is divide between contexts, being used with <hr/>or <hr>
   - Break Rule element is <br/> or <br>, used what it named to break the sentence and go a line down. like the \n in the Python.

8. **CSS: The Style**  
   - CSS handles the **styling** of a website, such as colors, fonts, and layouts—similar to painters decorating a house.
   - You can specify the appearance of HTML elements using CSS (e.g., making a button red with white text in Arial).

9. **JavaScript: The Behavior**  
   - JavaScript adds **functionality** to a website, allowing it to interact with users, like an electrician wiring a house.
   - It makes websites dynamic by enabling actions such as clicking buttons and submitting forms.

10. **Inspecting website elements**  
    - Using Chrome Developer Tools, you can right-click and inspect elements of a website to see its HTML structure and make temporary edits for testing or fun.
    - However, refreshing the page will reload the original content from the server.

11. **Building your own websites**  
    - By learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you'll be able to create your own websites with custom designs, content, and functionality.
    - You can host these websites live on the internet for others to access.

12. **Extensions in Visual Studio**  
    - Extensions are like plugins that extend the functionality of VSCode.
