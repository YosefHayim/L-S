## Day 19: Key Takeaways

1. **Event Listeners**  
   - Learned how to implement event listeners to trigger actions based on user interaction.

2. **Passing Functions as Arguments**  
   - When passing a function as an argument, omit parentheses unless calling it immediately.

3. **Higher-Order Functions**  
   - Functions that take other functions as arguments or return them, enabling a layered structure of main and sub-functions.

4. **Object Instances**  
   - Multiple instances can be created from the same class, each with its own attributes and behaviors. These instances function independently, allowing different states and actions.

5. **GUI Coordinates**  
   - GUIs are structured on an X, Y coordinate system. The X-axis controls width, and the Y-axis controls height. For example, with a height of 600, the upper half ranges from 0 to +300, and the lower half ranges from 0 to -300.
