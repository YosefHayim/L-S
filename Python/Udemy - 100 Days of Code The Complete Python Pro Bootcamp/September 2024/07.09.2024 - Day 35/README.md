## Day 35: Key Takeaways

1. **Learning About API Keys, Authentication, Environment Variables, and Sending SMS**  
   - Focused on how to authenticate APIs, manage API keys, and use environment variables, including sending SMS messages via an API.

2. **Why APIs Are Charged**  
   - API providers charge for usage to cover infrastructure costs, offer valuable data or services, support development and maintenance, limit usage, and generate revenue.

3. **Importance of Reading API Documentation**  
   - Reading API documentation is crucial, as it can reveal shortcut methods, reducing the need for unnecessary code.

4. **Sending SMS Using an API**  
   - Learned how to use an API to send an SMS to my phone, which was a fun and educational experience.

5. **Environment Variables for Security**  
   - Environment variables store sensitive information, such as API keys, separately from the code to avoid security risks when sharing code publicly.

6. **Flexible Configurations with Environment Variables**  
   - Environment variables allow for easy updates to configurations without modifying the codebase, which is particularly useful in large or dynamic applications.

7. **API Interaction and Security**  
   - Combining APIs to interact with external services and using environment variables for security is an essential skill in modern programming.
