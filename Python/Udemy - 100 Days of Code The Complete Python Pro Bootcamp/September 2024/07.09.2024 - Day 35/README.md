Key points of day 35:
1 - Learning About API Keys, Authentication, Environment variables, and Sending SMS.
2 - People charge for APIs to cover infrastructure costs, provide valuable data or services, support development and maintenance, limit usage, and generate revenue.
3 - It's very important to read the API doc, so I can avoid some external code lines to write since the API doc could have some shortcut methods for it.
4 - It was very fun and educational to learn how to use API to send to my phone an SMS.
5 - Environment variables allow you to store sensitive information (like API keys) separately from your code, helping avoid security risks when sharing code publicly.
6 - Environment variables provide a flexible way to update configurations in your code without modifying the codebase, especially useful for large or dynamic applications.
7 - The use of APIs to interact with external services, combined with the security of environment variables, is an essential skill in modern programming.
