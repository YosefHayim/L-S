## Day 54: Key Takeaways

1. **What I am going to build today?**
   - Web development using Flask, a popular Python framework for websites.
   - Learn about the command line, Python decorators, and backend development.
   - Focus on building both frontend (HTML/CSS) and backend (using Python/Flask).

2. **Things I learned or concluded from today's lesson**
   - Websites have two parts: frontend (user interface) and backend (logic and database).
   - Frontend: Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   - Backend: Built with various languages like Python, JavaScript, or Ruby, often using frameworks like Flask or Django.
   - Full-stack development involves working on both frontend and backend.
   - Backend components include the client (user browser), server (computer that handles requests), and database (stores website data).
   - Flask is good for beginners and small projects, while Django is for larger projects.
   - Analogy: Frontend is like the restaurant's seating area (client), the kitchen is the server, and the larder is the database.
   - When writing pip in the terminal or cmd to install some package of Python it goes to pypi and search for that package and then installs it on our local machin.
   - To quit the Flask server press `crtl + c`
   - the command line also known as a shell,

3. **What is a framework?**
   - A framework is a structured package of code that developers use to build applications.
   - Unlike libraries (like BeautifulSoup or requests), a framework like Flask requires you to follow its rules and architecture.
   - In a framework, your code is called by the framework based on specific triggers, unlike libraries where you call their functions directly.
   - Flask is a minimal framework that simplifies backend development by handling common functionalities like routing and HTTP responses.
   - Reading the documentation is important to understand how to work within the framework and avoid conflicts like naming files incorrectly.
