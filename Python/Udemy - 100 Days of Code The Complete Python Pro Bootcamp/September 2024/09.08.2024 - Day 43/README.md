## Day [NUM]: Key Takeaways

1. **What CSS Stands for?**

- **CSS**: It allows you to style your HTML to make websites visually appealing. It separates **content** (HTML) from **style** (CSS).
- **Cascading**: The term "cascading" refers to how styles flow from general rules down to more specific ones, similar to a waterfall.
- **Style Sheet**: Just as HTML is a **markup language**, CSS is a **style language** that tells the browser how elements should look.
- **History**: In the early days of the internet, HTML was the only option, and developers couldnâ€™t easily style web pages. Early attempts (like using font tags) cluttered HTML with styling code, making it difficult to maintain.
- **CSS Introduction**: In 1996, CSS was introduced to allow for the separation of styling and content. This made web design much cleaner and more maintainable.
- **Example**: By toggling CSS on and off in a simple HTML page, you can see how drastically CSS transforms the layout and appearance of the page without changing the HTML code.
