Key points of day 30:
1 - Learning about Errors, Exceptions and Saving JSON data.
2 - Exceptions have the 4 families: try, except, else, finally.
    A. try - something that might cause an exception
    B. except - Do this if there was an exception
    C. else - do this if there were no exceptions
    D. finally - do this no matter what happens
3 - I cannot do a nested expected in the else block. 
4 - The else block has the same point of the regular conditions I am familiar with.
5 - The try and expect block are special because I can catch the error
6 - expect has additional methods which can be catch the errors by the type errors. e.g. KeyError,FileNotFoundError / KeyError
7 - Using the same function inside a function with a try expect block or if else will cause an infinite while loop without using the while method.
