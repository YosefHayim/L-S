## Day 37: Key Takeaways

1. **Today's Learnings**  
   - Advanced Authentication.
   - POST / PUT / DELETE API Requests.
   - Using the Pixela API.

2. **HTTP Requests**
   - **GET**: For making a GET request, we use `requests.get()`.
   - **POST**: For making a POST request, we use `requests.post()`.
   - **PUT**: For making a PUT request, we use `requests.put()`.
   - **DELETE**: For making a DELETE request, we use `requests.delete()`.

3. **Things I Learned from Today's Lesson**
   - Using the `response.text` method returns the response content as text. This can include the raw HTML, JSON, or a status code like `200 OK`.
   - **HEADERS**: Headers contain metadata or additional information about the request or response (e.g., content type, authentication tokens).
   - **BODY**: The actual message part, which can contain the data sent in a request (e.g., JSON payload in POST requests).
   - The 's' in **HTTPS** stands for **secure**, indicating that the communication is encrypted using SSL/TLS.
