Key points of day 27:
1 - Learning Graphical User interfaces using Tkinter and functions arguments using the Tkinter library.
2 - Learning about Advanced functions, default Arguments , *args,**Kwargs
3 - Building a mile to km convertor.
4 - GUI stands for graphic user interface.
5 - The Macintosh XL, commonly known as the Macintosh Lisa or Mac Lisa, was a personal computer released by Apple in January 1983 - It was originally named Apple Lisa and is known for being one of the first personal computers to offer a graphical user interface (GUI), alongside a mouse-driven system.
6 - Apple had program windows before windows actually existed
7 -  Apple did sue Microsoft over the use of the graphical user interface (GUI), claiming that Microsoft had infringed on its intellectual property related to the Macintosh GUI - Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the case and its outcome:
8 - Xerox PARC invented or contributed to a wide range of foundational technologies, including Ethernet (LAN), the GUI, the mouse, laser printing, and object-oriented programming, all of which have had a lasting impact on the world of computing and networking.
9 - Watch the movie Pirates of Silicon valley (1999)
10 - *args lets you pass any number of arguments to the function.
11 - kwargs allows passing any number of keyword arguments to a function.
12 - Collected keyword arguments in kwargs are stored as a dictionary.
13 - You can access specific keyword arguments via their keys, e.g., kwargs["key"].
14 - kwargs provides flexibility when defining functions, avoiding the need to specify every argument beforehand.
15 - *args is used to accept a variable number of positional arguments in a function.
16 - Positional arguments collected by *args are stored in a tuple.
17 - The get method for dictionaries safely retrieves values without causing KeyError if the key is missing.
18 - get allows specifying a default value if a key is not present.
19 - kwargs enables dynamic handling of optional arguments in functions or classes.
20 - Tkinter uses kwargs to manage various optional GUI properties, like text and font.
21 - You can loop over kwargs.items() to get both keys and values.
22 - kwargs makes class initialization flexible, allowing optional parameters to be passed easily.
23 - Using the library Tkinter and the class pack are hardcoded to place it to a specific direction for that I would use the place class.
24 - The Tkinter has also a class called Grid which allow to set the buttons, labels, inputs, etc. by an Excel sheet position like column and row.
25 - I cannot use Grid and pack classes together either Pack, Grid or the place classes.
