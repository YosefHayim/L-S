Key points of day :
1 - have I been pwned is a website that checks if your data has been compromised: https://haveibeenpwned.com
2 - for loop is going each item in something and do something or not do something with each item in something.
3 - To print a loop variable outside the loop in Python, store the loop variable in another variable inside the loop, then print that variable after the loop finishes, else it won't work.
4 - Order of Conditions Matters, The order of if, elif, and else conditions matters in Python. 
    The more specific or complex conditions should come first (like checking i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0) 
    before simpler conditions (like i % 3 == 0). This ensures that the correct code block runs.
    If you check for i % 3 == 0 first, it would print Fizz and never check the more specific FizzBuzz condition.
