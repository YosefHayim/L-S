Key points of day 3:
1 - In some scenarios instead of doing nested if I can just use a double condition in the first if to confirm what I need. this will make the code more readable.
2 - elif statement is use when the first condition or the previous condition isn't true.
3 - else statement is use when none of the previous conditions are true.
4 - I can write only if statements to check if everything is being true. this means that every previous condition must be true in order to proceed to the next one
