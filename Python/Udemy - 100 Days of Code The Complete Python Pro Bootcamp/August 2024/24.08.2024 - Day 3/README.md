## Day 3: Key Takeaways

1. **Simplifying with Double Conditions**  
   - Learned that in some cases, instead of using nested `if` statements, I can use a double condition in a single `if` statement to make the code more readable.

2. **`elif` Statement**  
   - The `elif` statement is used when the first condition (or previous conditions) isn't true, allowing for multiple conditional checks.

3. **`else` Statement**  
   - The `else` statement is used when none of the previous conditions are met, providing a fallback action.

4. **Chaining `if` Statements**  
   - I can use multiple `if` statements to check sequential conditions. Each `if` block will only execute if the previous conditions are true.
