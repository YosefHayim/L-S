Key points of day 10:
1 - Functions with Outputs is another type of functions with parameters
2 - end day will build a calculator app.
3 - The way functions with outputs works is by using the return keyword which returns it to the global scope.
4 - I can either assign a variable to the function to get access to the global scope result of the function 
5 - Or I can just add the method e.g. print to the entire function and e.g. it will print the return result.
6 - I can do a nested function which means calling one function with another by having the result of it from the return keyword.
7 - The use of the keyword returns converts to the pc that the operation in the function is over.
8 - Everything that comes after the return won't execute, unless it's indented with a condition then it is in another scope.
9 - Indentation matters: The return statement must be inside the function and indented correctly.
10 - return ends the function: Once Python hits return, it stops executing the function and sends back the result.
11 - Multiple return statements: You can have multiple return statements in a function, often used with conditions (e.g., if statements).
12 - Did a very well exercise 10 of the leap year with the indentation of each if and else.
13 - Docstrings are a more improved type of comment that allowed to do a multiple comments lines.
14 - Angela Yu showed me the possibility of attaching only the function to a variable and then call that variable with the keyword arguments to pass the function parameters.
15 - The project Calculator was I would say medium level since it required from me to follow the conditions and the indentation accordingly, anyway feeling I am getting better.
16 - I am going to keep use the draw.io excellent tool!
17 - Having repeating code shouldest be written, instead I should use other things which are loops.
18 - Recession is calling the function inside itself.
