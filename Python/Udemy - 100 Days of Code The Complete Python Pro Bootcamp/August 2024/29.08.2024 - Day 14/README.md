## Day 14: Key Takeaways

1. **Progress on Game Logic**  
   - Managed to complete 85%-90% of the game logic but got stuck on updating the algorithm for checking user correctness.

2. **Deep Learning Phase**  
   - It was a productive day with significant progress on the project. Learned a lot, but my brain is feeling exhausted from all the intense work.
