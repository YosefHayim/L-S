Key points of day 7 :
1 - The hangman project was difficult at stage 3, the rest was easier... I spent around 2 hours to analyse few methods, but I guess I didn't think enough on how to solve it.
    for next time, I should stop and think maybe use draw.io or understand what it is being requested from.
2 - Use more draw.io helps break down how to translate into code.
3 - I use the import module from other files and understand how it works.
