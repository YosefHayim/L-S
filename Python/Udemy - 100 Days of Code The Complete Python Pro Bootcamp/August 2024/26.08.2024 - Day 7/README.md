## Day 7: Key Takeaways

1. **Hangman Project Challenges**  
   - Stage 3 of the Hangman project was quite challenging, and I spent about 2 hours analyzing different methods. I realized I didnâ€™t spend enough time thinking through the solution.  
   - Next time, I should pause and reflect more, perhaps using tools like draw.io to better understand the requirements before diving into code.

2. **Visualizing with draw.io**  
   - Using draw.io is helpful to break down problems and translate them into code more effectively.

3. **Importing Modules**  
   - I practiced importing modules from other files and gained a better understanding of how the import process works in Python.
