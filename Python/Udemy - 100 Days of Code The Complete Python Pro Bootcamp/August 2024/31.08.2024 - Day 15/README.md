Key Points of day 15:
1 - Input Validation: Ensured valid user input for drink selection (espresso/latte/cappuccino/off/report).
2- Modular Code Structure: Functions like prompt_user, check_resources_is_sufficent, and insert_coins_by_user help in organizing the code.
3 - Resource Management: Managed available ingredients and updated resources post-drink preparation.
4 - Financial Transactions: Simulated coin insertion and payment handling.
5 - Control Flow: Used loops and conditionals to manage program logic.
6 - Using the shortcut Alt + shift allows me to type to multiple lines the same typing, can save a lot of time.
7 - Reverse double quotes from pdfs are not acceptable in Python.
8 - Python PEP8 guide is recommender to use a maximum of 120 letters when using docstrings or a hashtag for comments to help the developers.
9 - REMINDER TO USE THE global method to make a global scope word to be use inside the functions which are "local scope".
10 - Learning at a studying area - library meditak is better than learning at home because the brain is more seriously taking the leraning phase.

Potential Pitfalls:
6 - Hardcoded Values: Be cautious with hardcoding, e.g., espresso_milk = 0.
7 - Type Checking: Ensure user input is the correct type (integers) and non-negative.
8 - Return Values: Handle cases where None is returned to avoid unpacking errors.
9 - Global Variables: Direct modification of global resources can lead to side effects.
10 - Assumption of Success: Consider handling failed transactions more explicitly.
11 - Naming Conventions: Use consistent and clear variable names for readability.
