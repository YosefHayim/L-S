How blackjack game works?:
### Card Values:
- Number cards (2-10): Face value.
- Face cards (Jack, Queen, King): Worth 10 points each.
- Ace: Can be worth either 1 or 11 points, depending on which value is more advantageous for the player.

### How the Game Works:
1. **The Deal:** 
   - The player and the dealer are each dealt two cards. The player’s cards are both face-up, while the dealer has one card face-up and one face-down (called the "hole" card).

2. **Player's Turn:**
   - **Hit:** The player can ask for additional cards to get closer to 21. The player can "hit" as many times as they want.
   - **Stand:** The player can decide to stop taking cards when they are satisfied with their hand.
   - **Bust:** If the player’s hand exceeds 21, they automatically lose the round (this is called a "bust").

3. **Dealer's Turn:**
   - After the player stands, the dealer reveals their hidden card.
   - The dealer must hit (take additional cards) if their total is 16 or less.
   - The dealer must stand if their total is 17 or more.
   - If the dealer busts by going over 21, the player wins.

4. **Winning:**
   - If the player has a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer without busting, the player wins.
   - If the dealer has a higher hand value without busting, the dealer wins.
   - If both have the same hand value, it's a "push" (tie), and the player neither wins nor loses.
