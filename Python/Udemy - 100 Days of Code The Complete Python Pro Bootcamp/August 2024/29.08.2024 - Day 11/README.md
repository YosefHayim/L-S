## Day 11: Key Takeaways

1. **Building the Blackjack Project**  
   - Successfully built the Blackjack project after 6 hours of work! A key lesson learned: never give up, keep pushing, and stay patient—success will come.
   
2. **Accomplished Without Clues!**  
   - Completed the project without any external clues, except for one related to handling the Ace.

### How the Blackjack Game Works:

#### **Card Values:**
- **Number cards (2-10):** Face value.
- **Face cards (Jack, Queen, King):** Worth 10 points each.
- **Ace:** Can be worth either 1 or 11 points, whichever is more advantageous for the player.

#### **Game Flow:**

1. **The Deal:**  
   - The player and the dealer each receive two cards. The player’s cards are both face-up, while the dealer has one face-up and one face-down (the "hole" card).

2. **Player's Turn:**  
   - **Hit:** The player can request additional cards to get closer to 21. The player can "hit" as many times as needed.  
   - **Stand:** The player can stop taking cards when satisfied with their hand.  
   - **Bust:** If the player's total exceeds 21, they automatically lose (called a "bust").

3. **Dealer's Turn:**  
   - After the player stands, the dealer reveals their hidden card.  
   - The dealer must hit if their total is 16 or less.  
   - The dealer must stand if their total is 17 or more.  
   - If the dealer busts by exceeding 21, the player wins.

4. **Winning Conditions:**  
   - The player wins if their hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's without busting.  
   - The dealer wins if they have a higher hand value without busting.  
   - A "push" (tie) occurs if both the player and dealer have the same hand value.
