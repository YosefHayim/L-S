# # The print function to printing to the console:
# print('Hello World')

# # Coding Exercise 1: Printing Intelligence:
# print("1. Mix 500g of Flour, 10g Yeast and 300ml Water in a bowl.")
# print("2. Knead the dough for 10 minutes.")
# print("3. Add 3g of Salt.")
# print("4. Leave to rise for 2 hours.")
# print("5. Bake at 200 degrees C for 30 minutes.")

# # Coding Exercise 2: Debugging Practice:
# print("Notes from Day 1")
# print("The print statement is used to output strings")
# print("Strings are strings of characters")
# print("String Concatenation is done with the + sign")
# print("New lines can be created with a \n and the letter n")

# # The input function to receive and store the data from the user input command line / terminal:
# isName = input('What is your name?: ')
# print('Hello ' + isName + "!")

# I can re-assign variables in different part of the code so each of them has a new variable:
# name = 'Yosef'
# print('This is the first print',name)
# name = 'Josephine'
#
# # This will print the most updated variable it contains unless I add another print before it.
# print('This is the second print',name)

# Counting the length of a string by using the len function
# name = 'Yosef'
# LengthName = len(name)
# print('The name variable has:',LengthName,'letters in the word')

# Coding Exercise 3: Variables
# We have 2 variables glass1 and glass2. glass1 contains milk and glass2 contains juice.
# Write 3 lines of code to switch the contents of the variables.
# You are not allowed to type the words "milk" or "juice".
# You are only allowed to use variables to solve this exercise.
#
# glass1 = "milk"
# glass2 = "juice"
#
# glass3 = glass1
# glass1 = glass2
# glass2 = glass3
