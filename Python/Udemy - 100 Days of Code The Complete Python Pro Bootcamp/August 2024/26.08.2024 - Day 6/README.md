Key points of day 6:
1 - There are some built-in functions that I am using in the global area. e.g. print() / len() etc...
2 - Functions has parameters that we can pass through, just like in JavaScript.
3 - Angela Yu has introduced me to Reeborg's world to learn more easily and understandable functions in Python.
4 - In functions after the column must be indented (shifted to the right by 4 spaces).
5 - Python PEP 8 guide prefer to use spaces instead of tabs.
6 - Python developers who use spaces are been make more money than developers who use tabs, statistically.
7 - in while loops in python it must be checked against a condition so e.g.
    Example of the structure of a while loop:
    while something_is_true < number | boolean, etc:
        print("I love python")
        something_is_true += 1
        # Do something repeatedly

8 - Use a for loops when you know the exact number of iterations.
9 - Use a while loops when the number of iterations depends on a condition being true or false.
10 - Tip from Angela Yu, if I don't understand why I faced an infinite loop, add a print statement with the condition inside it to see what's the result provides in each loop.
11 - Practicing a lot of nested conditions which is great practice to understand how conditions working!
