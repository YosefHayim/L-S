Key points of day 9:
1 - Dictionaries in python works similarity like objects in javascript.
2 - Dictionaries built by two things, key and a value.
3- To create a dictionary I use curly braces, the key goes first then it follows the value.
4 - Dictionaries have elements that are identified by their keys.
5 - Angela Yu, recommends to start with empty dictionary.
6 - in dictionaries I cannot use the += I need to just use the = and use this structure for adding
    dictionary[nameofkey] = "detailofthevalue"
7 - There is a subject in dictionaries called nesting lists and dictionaries which allow me to store to one key value a huge list or another dictionary to it.
8 - to add to a dictionary a key with a new value all I need to do is just insert in the brackets e.g. dictionary[""] a key that isn't already in the dictionary, if it is it will modify the value of it
9 - The project was pretty easy finished it within 20-40 min, means I understand the concept of dictionaries pretty good.
10 - Using the draw.io is an excellent tool to convert my logic into a diagram to understand better how the flow is going to be.
