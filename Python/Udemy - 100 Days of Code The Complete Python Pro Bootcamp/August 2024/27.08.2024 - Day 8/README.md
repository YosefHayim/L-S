## Day 8: Key Takeaways

1. **Functions with Inputs**  
   - Learned how to use functions with inputs (parameters).

2. **Caesar Cipher Project**  
   - Built a Caesar Cipher project based on the ancient technique of sending encrypted and decrypted messages to armies.

3. **Parameters vs. Arguments**  
   - When I define a function and include variables in parentheses, they are called parameters.  
   - When I call the function and provide values for those variables, they are called arguments.

4. **Positional Arguments**  
   - Positional arguments require that the order of the arguments matches the order of the parameters when calling a function.

5. **Keyword Arguments**  
   - Keyword arguments allow passing arguments by assigning them directly to their corresponding parameters, without needing to follow the same order.

6. **Understanding Tasks Before Coding**  
   - Reading and fully understanding the tasks is crucial. I misunderstood the requirements initially, leading to confusion and unnecessary deep dives into the wrong areas.

7. **Small Syntax Mistakes Matter**  
   - A single missing bracket, parenthesis, or curly brace can have a big impact on the entire code.

8. **Importance of Condition Order**  
   - The order of conditions in the code is critical. I struggled with this in the Caesar Cipher step 5 at TODO 2.

9. **Enjoying `while` Loops**  
   - `while` loops are easy to understand and fun to use, but I need more practice with beginner-intermediate level exercises.

10. **Continue Using draw.io**  
   - Keep using draw.io to strengthen core fundamentals and visualize problem-solving.
