Key points of day 8:
1 - Learning about functions with inputs.
2 - Building Caesar Cipher project based on the ancient strategy to send decrypted and encrypted letters to armies.
3 - In functions when I pass a parameter inside the parenthesis it's called parameter.
4 - when I execute a function and pass to it a data in the parenthesis that's called argument.
5 - There is something called Positional arguments which basically says if I pass 3 parameters lets say a,b,c then the arguments must match the same order of it.
6 - There is something called Keyword arguments, which means when we execute the function I assign to it the parameter, so it identify it without having the same order.
7 - Reading and understanding the tasks is the most important things. Cause of that I misunderstood and dived too deep without understanding where the issue is.
8 - sometimes the missing of one two small square brackets/parenthesis/curly braces can impact the entire code.
9 - Huge importance to the way the code is ordered in the conditions, I felt today very confused with the conditions in the ceasar cipher step 5 at the TODO 2...
10 - While loops are fun and cute easy understanding, just need more practice of beginner-intermediate level exercises.
11 - Keep using draw.io for building a strong core of fundamentals!
