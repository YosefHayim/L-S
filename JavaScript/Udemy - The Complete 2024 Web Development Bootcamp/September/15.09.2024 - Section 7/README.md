## Section 7: Key Takeaways

1. **Positioning Overview**

   - Four types of CSS positioning: Static, Relative, Absolute, and Fixed.
   - Positioning affects the layout and behavior of elements on the page.
   - Misunderstanding positioning can lead to issues with layout, either on websites or in design.

2. **Static Positioning**

   - Default for all HTML elements; no special positioning applied.
   - Elements flow naturally in the document as they are written in the HTML code.

3. **Relative Positioning**

   - Position of an element can be adjusted relative to its default/static position.
   - Moving elements with `top`, `left`, `right`, and `bottom` properties.

4. **Absolute Positioning**

   - Positions an element relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (element with `position` set).
   - If no positioned ancestor exists, the element is placed relative to the top-left corner of the webpage.

5. **Fixed Positioning**

   - Element stays fixed relative to the browser window.
   - Does not move when scrolling; remains in the same place regardless of page scroll.

6. **Z-Index and Positioning**

   - Z-Index controls the layering of positioned elements along the Z-axis.
   - Higher `z-index` means the element appears on top of others.

7. **Practical Example**
   - Practical challenge: positioning a rectangle and circle using absolute and relative positioning.
   - Moving elements within the parent container and understanding position-based adjustments.
