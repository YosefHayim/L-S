## Section 1: Key Takeaways

1. **How does the Internet work?**

   - The Internet is a large network of wires connecting computers worldwide.
   - Some computers (servers) are always online to serve data to user computers (clients).
   - Undersea cables connect continents, transmitting data through fiber optics at high speeds.

2. **How are requests handled?**

   - When you request a website, your browser sends a message to your Internet Service Provider (ISP).
   - The ISP forwards the request to a DNS server, which translates the website name into an IP address.
   - Your browser then directly requests the website from the server using the IP address.
